for setting the airflow open your terminal and go to the path you have put your airflow_ssh.yaml and run this commad on your terminal: 
docker-compose -f airflow_ssh.yaml up --build -d

if everything is not working well go to the path again and run this code:
docker-compose -f airflow_ssh.yaml down


Have fun!
